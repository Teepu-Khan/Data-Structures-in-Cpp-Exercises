# Data-Structures-in-Cpp-Exercises

Programmer: Teepu Khan

These programs were created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. Generally, they are fairly simple, demonstrating a skill displayed
within a particular chapter of the Data Structures in C++ book. The cpp files have appropriate descriptions and comments to guide 
the user if they have questions.

I've chosen exercises that I feel are representative of the concepts presented in the chapter, in order to mitigate an overabundance 
of repetitive programs.

Since most of these programs are designed to be run easily, they can generally be run without the need for complex libraries, to
the extent of just copying code into new cpp files if the viewer desires.

This will hold true for all the programs in this folder. If there are exceptions, I will have a readme file within that folder to
indicate any special needs.

As a final note, I want to mention that cheating is never acceptable if you are a student. In the unlikely case that your courses 
use this particular textbook and exercise, then remember to always do your own work and not to simply copy somebody else's.
